We're thrilled that you want to share your ideas and knowledge with our wonderful community. We welcome all sorts of talks—from workshops to short lightning talks to longer deep dives. We especially love and welcome first time speakers. 

To submit you'll need a Github account. If you don't have one, go ahead and [create an account](https://github.com/). 

1. Open a [new issue](https://github.com/GothamSass/centralpark/issues/new)
1. If you have a **talk title**, go ahead an enter it. If not, a short, concise title describing your talk will suffice
1. Tell us what you plan on talking about in the description. Be as detailed as possible. Don't worry about pitching to us, this isn't as formal as a conference proposal, but you can use it for practice. If you have links, share them. Here are some things to think about?
